### 🎯 Task 2: Number Guessing Game  

**Description**:  
The "Number Guessing Game" is a simple yet engaging Java application that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number by the computer. It combines logic and luck, making it a fun and interactive project.  

---

#### 💡 How It Works  

1. The system generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).  
2. The user is prompted to guess the number through a displayed input box.  
3. Feedback is provided after each guess:  
   - If the guess is correct, the user wins the round.  
   - If the guess is incorrect, the system indicates whether the number is **higher** or **lower**.  
4. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts (if a limit is set).
